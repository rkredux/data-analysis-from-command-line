# Data Analysis From Command Line

This repository is a place where I share commands to do data analysis from terminal.

The data used for the analysis is the system data made available by the Capital Bike Share that operates in the Washington DC Metro Area

1. To begin with, download the data for all of 2018 (or for the year you want to run analysis for) from the link below (One file for each month) https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data

2. Unzip all the files and place all CSVs in a folder.

3. Head over to that folder and run the commands shared in this repo.
